JFrame - Top level container in the Swing GUI toolkit. It represents a window on the screen and serves as the foundation of creating GUI-based Java applications.
Essentially, it's the main window where other GUI components like buttons, labels, text fields and panels are placed to build an interactive application.
JLabel - Swing GUI component, used for displaying a short string of text, an image or combination of both. It serves primarily as a display element and is considered a passive control, meaning it does not generate events upon user interactions like buttons or checkboxes do.
setBounds - method in Java is used to manually set the position and size of a GUI within its parent container. This method is part of the java.awt.Component class.
